# Golang Explorations
## Prime number identification
====

- Here we use Go to identify prime numbers in a given range using language features such as channels and goroutines to divide the workload.

While there is a progression of functionality (e.g., command-line argument handling) and some optimization, this is intended as a demonstration of the language and its features, as well as the pros and cons involved as we progress through multiple iterations of the program.
