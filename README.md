# Golang Explorations
## Explorations with the Go programming language

As I continue to expand my knowledge of Go, I'm sharing some of the things I've learned along the way. These explorations are shown as progressions and are meant to be instructive, not comprehensive. There may be bugs or idiomatic discrepancies, but the intent is to show the path of learning and (major) iteration as much as the end result.

*Unless otherwise noted I am using the latest stable release of GO for these (1.3.3 for Windows x64 currently).*

The explorations thus far:

1 - Prime number identification - In the first major exploration, we use Go to identify prime numbers in a given range, demonstrating various language features such as channels and goroutines to divide the workload.
